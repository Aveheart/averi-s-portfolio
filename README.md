# averi-s-portfolio
## Description
I made a portfolio for myself using html and css. This will be a good way for future employers and clientele to view my work and get my contact information. I learned that it takes a lot of time and effort to build something from scratch and will be continuing to strengthen my skills to make my next work better.
